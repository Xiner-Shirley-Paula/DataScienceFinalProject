Healthcare policy researchers have devoted much effort toward finding solutions to the fast growth in health care spending over the past decades. Research has provided evidence that the growth is linked to modifiable population risk factors such as obesity and stress. Rising disease prevalence and new medical treatments account for nearly two-thirds of the rising spending. As Massachusetts residents, we are directly concerned with how the state controls its healthcare cost. As one article in Boston Globe put it, “The soaring costs of insuring the state’s poorest residents drove health care spending in Massachusetts up 4.8 percent last year, double the rate of growth in 2013, dealing a setback to the state’s efforts to contain medical costs.” \r\n\r\nTherefore, predicting such costs with accuracy is a significant first step in address this problem, and may reveal insights into the nature of the key drivers of costs.\r\n\r\n####Goals\r\n1) to utilize regression-based methods and modern machine learning techniques to identify high-cost patients and predict their cost of care based on past year cost data and medical information (we define high cost patient as Medicare beneficiaries in MA with top 10% most expensive spending under Medicare part A and B coverage); \r\n\r\n2) to obtain more accurate prediction by dividing health cost into buckets (potentially 5 buckets) from high to low, and predict patients most likely cost buckets in the second year based on past year cost data and medical information;\r\n\r\n3) to identify the factors that are most influential in determining which patients will be high cost.\r\n\r\n##Initial Questions\r\nTask: What questions are you trying to answer? How did these questions evolve over the course of the project? What new questions did you consider in the course of your analysis?\r\n\r\n##Data\r\nWe collected 20% sample of Massachusetts Medicare Fee-For-Service Beneficiaries with their healthcare cost breaking into different settings where their medical utilization occur. \r\n\r\nThe original data source comes from Medicare Claims Data Set (from Centers for Medicare and Medicaid). The original data files we derived our analytic dataset from included: Denominator File, Inpatient File, Outpatient Fil, Carrier File, Skilled Nursing Facility File, Hospice File, Home Health Agency File, and Durable Medical Equipment File. They cover all medical claims and associated costs for Medicare FFS beneficiaries, except drugs which we did not incorporate into our analyses, because we are interested in medical cost only. \r\n\r\n###Data preparation\r\nWe used a 20% sample of Massachusetts Medicare Fee-For-Service Beneficiaries and claims associated with them in 2012 and 2013 (2011 is our first year and 2012 is our second year). We did not have individual identifiable information. Since the original dataset was at claim-level, we had to do some pre-processing and wrangling to get our final dataset, which is at beneficiary-level (or patient-level). Our analytic dataset will includes the following information: Diagnosis Clinical Classification, Procedure Clinical Classification, Medical utilizations (hospitalization, outpatient visits, physician visits, and more detailed utilization categories), Medical costs (in each setting), patient age, patient gender, and patient race. These were our features for prediction.\r\n\r\n##Exploratory Analysis\r\nTask: What visualizations did you use to look at your data in different ways? What are the different statistical methods you considered? Justify the decisions you made, and show any major changes to your ideas. How did you reach these conclusions?\r\n\r\n####Modeling \r\n**Prediction**\r\n* Logistic Regression \r\n* Naive Bayes Classification \r\n* Decision Tree\r\n* Support Vector Machine \r\n* Linear Discriminative Analysis or Quadratic Discriminative Analysis\r\n* Random Forest\r\n\r\n**Identifying influential features**\r\n* Feature Selection or Dimension Reduction(Principal Component Analysis) \r\n\r\n####Analysis\r\n* Choose performance metrics \r\n* Compare performance of the different methods through cross-validation\r\n* Test model sensitivity to changes in input / assumptions\r\n\r\n\r\n##Final Analysis and Predictions\r\nTask: What did you learn about the data? How did you answer the questions? How can you justify your answers?\r\nSummarize and Visualize the highly influential factors from different predictive models\r\nIf we have time, maybe we can see how variable this is, e.g., between different demographics or years\r\n\r\n####Related Work\r\nTask: Anything that inspired you, such as a paper, a web site, or something we discussed in class.\r\n#### Authors and Contributors\r\nThis project was created by Xiner (@xz2315), Shirley(@shirley-g), and Paula (@paulaj) for  BIO 260 and CSCI E107. \r\n\r\n#### Support or Contact\r\nWant to know more about this project?
