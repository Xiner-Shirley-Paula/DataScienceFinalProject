description: LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) is a regression analysis method that performs both variable selection and regularization in order to enhance the prediction accuracy and interpretability of the statistical model it produces. LASSO forces the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients to be less than a fixed value, which results in certain coefficients to be set to be zero, effectively removing those variables from the model, making the model simpler and more interpretable. The regularization parameter, lambda, governs the degree to which the coefficients are penalized. <br><br> To implement LASSO regression in this project, we use glmnet. Glmnet is an R package that fits a generalized linear model via penalized maximum likelihood. The regularization path is computed for the LASSO penalty at a grid of values for the regularization parameter lambda. <br><br> Here we predict whether a patient will be in the top 10% in terms of 2013 spending based on their chronic conditions indicators. The LASSO model is trained using 80% of the data, and then validating using the remaining 20%. The sensitivity and specificity are reported for the test set.<img src="img/glmnet.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""> The optimal regularization parameters identified by the cv.glmnet method are shown below. Lmin gives the model with the smallest misclassification error. L gives the most regularized model such that error is within one standard error of the minimum error model. By having a higher degree of regularization, the model given by L is better protected against overfitting, whereas the Lmin has a higher chance of overfitting, but better prediction performance. <br><br>We now fit a the model with Lmin for lambda. (Note, we tried fitting the model with L, but the sensitivity reported for the test set prediction was lower in this model, so we chose the Lmin value). Let us see what features are selected by LASSO and their respective importance.<img src="img/portfolio/lasso.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
